  Jack5 and Zeroman95's Keymaster's Keep player file

  This Keymaster's Keep configuration combines our non-Archipelago-supported games and interests into a single player file, which is more condensed compared to the Keymaster's Keep default for both simplicity and an added challenge. The main difference is the goal being changed from 'Keymaster's Challenge' to 'Magic Key Heist', as we would prefer this config's completion not to hinge on a single challenge. We would at some point in the future like to have the goal be related to area completion in order to prevent our runs from arbitrarily ending.
