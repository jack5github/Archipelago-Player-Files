  Jack5's Dracomino player file

  This configuration for Dracomino makes the game significantly harder. It starts with me being forced to use multiple pentominoes, and keeps important items locked away in other games. The variety in this configuration comes from minos of size 1-3 having a random chance of occurring, though it is more likely for them to all not occur at all.

The issue with this is that every run would start with the exact same set of pentominoes that I specified. Instead, I have just reduced this to the number that lines up more with what I wanted to start with.
