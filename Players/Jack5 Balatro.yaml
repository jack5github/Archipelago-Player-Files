  Jack5's Balatro player file

  This configuration for Balatro intends to turn a game that is typically very grindy and difficult to beat into a more fun experience. All gameplay is limited to White Stake, with more of an emphasis being placed on finding Archipelago items in the shop, and beating decks as they are unlocked. Because of the easy difficulty, more decks need to be beaten for this game to be considered complete.

  # Enabled Mods #
  ################
  # All Balatro mods not listed here should be disabled:
  # - Archipelago Randomizer - Enables Archipelago support.
  # - Bakery - The charms in this mod provide a much needed buff to gameplay in certain situations.
  # - Bloonlatro - Hidden amidst all the references are some really powerful jokers.
  # - Blueprint - Makes the effects of blueprint jokers easier to understand.
  # - Celestial Funk - Easier to distinguish planet cards.
  # - Luna's Enhancements - Easier to distinguish enhancements.
  # - Malverk - Texture pack support.
  # - Moonspell Cards - Easier to distinguish tarot cards.
  # - Pingo - Allows Archipelago to interact with mods, though they are treated as vanilla items. IMPORTANT: Before starting a new run, go into this mod's files and delete 'logic.lua'.
  # - SDM_0's Stuff - Provides some really powerful incremental jokers that made many impossible runs possible.
  # - SystemClock - Show the current time in-game.
  # - Talisman - Support extremely high numbers if I ever get to that point.
  # - Trance - Balatro theming that makes the game more pleasant to look at.
  # Below is the rationale for why other mods are disabled:
  # - 3x Credits - Card crediting is not necessary for me to see during a run.
  # - AbsentDealer - Only a few of this mod's jokers are good, the rest are trash. The enhancements don't add much to the game when they aren't likely to be accessed.
  # - Battle for Jimbo - Only a few of this mod's jokers are good, the rest are trash.
  # - Buffoonery - The special jokers are likely to conflict with the other mods.
  # - Card Sleeves - Adding card sleeves would make the game too easy to beat, as these effects stack on decks.
  # - DebugPlus - Enables a whole bunch of cheats that should not be allowed.
  # - Galdur - Normally makes it easier to see what decks are unlocked, but the display breaks down when browsing stakes.
  # - Glue for Modpacks - Do not accidentally interfere with the balance of the game.
  # - Paperback - This mod is mostly useful for its enhancements and paperclips. All things considered, with how few of its jokers are beneficial in runs and with paperclips requiring complete commitment to the Clippy Joker, as well as with the Dichrome enhancement causing crashes, it is best not to play with this.
  # - Phanta - Includes far too many jokers that won't be that helpful.
  # - re:Unlock All - This isn't strictly necessary in order for the game to be randomised, and may lead to things being accessed earlier than intended.
  # - Reverie - The tickets in this mod can only be obtained from Cine Packs, which don't appear in the shop for most of the run, making their entire inclusion pointless.
