  Zeroman95's YAML for The Legend of Zelda.

  Not a fan of many NES games, but this game I really enjoy running through. I had to decrease my Progression Balancing due to getting my best Sword the Magical Sword too early, allowing me to run through a good chunk of the game really quickly.

game: The Legend of Zelda
requires:
  version: 0.6.4
