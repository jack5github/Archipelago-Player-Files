    # Default is false, only 1 map from each chapter is accessible and maps are unlocked through completing previous ones.

    # Minimum of 60 -> Over half of the starting maps are available from the get go, slightly slower start

    # You can define additional values between the minimum and maximum values. Minimum value is 60, maximum value is 100.
    # Portal 2 becomes boring the more Chapter 1 levels are made available at the start of the game, so I have set this option to its absolute minimum.
