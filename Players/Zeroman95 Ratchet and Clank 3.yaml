  Zeroman95's Ratchet and Clank 3 Player file

  This is the YAML file for Ratchet and Clank 3. Stay noted that the Ratchet and Clank 3 World is still in Alpha meaning it's still got unstable data and could break when used. Ratchet and Clank 3 is Zeroman95's most loved game of all time and this file will have the most challenge it can be to make it as difficult as possible to make it even more fun!
