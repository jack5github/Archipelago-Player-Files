  Jack5's The Witness player file

  This configuration for The Witness is meant to both streamline gameplay but keep the excitement of discovering new areas, so long as they are not tedious to complete. Of note is the ability to access the Caves early, with the central puzzle of that area rewarding a laser for its completion. The game can still be beaten simply by finding lasers in other games if it becomes too tedious. As The Witness is my most played game, this configuration also includes several properties that are randomised per run to keep the game interesting.

  puzzle_randomization:
    # Puzzles in this randomizer are randomly generated. This option changes the difficulty/types of puzzles.
    # "Sigma Normal" randomizes puzzles close to their original mechanics and difficulty.
    # "Sigma Expert" is an entirely new experience with extremely difficult random puzzles. Do not underestimate this mode, it is brutal.
    # "Umbra Variety" focuses on unique symbol combinations not featured in the original game. It is harder than Sigma Normal, but easier than Sigma Expert.
    # "None" means that the puzzles are unchanged from the original game.
    # I want to create new puzzles of the same difficulty as the original game, but to increase the variety of puzzles in the game, I've made new symbol combinations have a 25% chance of appearing.

    # - Mountain Box Long: Input the long solution to the Mountaintop Box (requires Challenge Lasers).
    # - Panel Hunt: Solve a specific number of randomly selected panels before going to the secret ending in Tutorial.
    # It is important to note that while the Mountain Box requires Desert Laser to be redirected in Town for that laser to count, the laser locks on the Elevator and Challenge Timer panels do not.
    # My preferred victory condition is to reach the earliest possible linear objective, which is Mountain Box Short. However, to increase variety, I have added an equal chance of the whole game needs to be completed (Elevator) and of Panel Hunt happening. No challenge goals are used.
