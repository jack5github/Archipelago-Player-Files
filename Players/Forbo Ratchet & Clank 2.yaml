  death_link:
    # When you die, everyone who enabled death link dies. Of course, the reverse is true too.
    'true': 50
  starting_weapons:
    # Randomize what two weapons you start the game with.
    # vanilla: Start with the Lancer and Gravity Bomb.
    # balanced: Start with two random weapons that are relatively balanced.
    # non_broken: Start with two random weapons besides RYNO II and Zodiac.
    # unrestricted: Start with any two non-upgraded weapons.
    balanced: 50
  randomize_megacorp_vendor:
    # Randomize what items appear at the Megacorp vendor. New items will get added as you visit more planets.
    'true': 50
  randomize_gadgetron_vendor:
    # Randomize what items appear at the Gadgetron vendor on Barlow.
    'false': 50
  exclude_very_expensive_items:
    # Exclude RYNO II and Zodiac from the randomization leaving them at their vanilla locations.
    # This will only take effect if the corresponding vendors are randomized.
    'true': 50
  skip_wupash_nebula:
    # Skips the Wupash Nebula ship section that appears when first traveling to Maktar Nebula.
    'true': 50
  enable_bolt_multiplier:
    # Enables the bolt multiplier feature without being in New Game+.
    'false': 50
  no_revisit_reward_change: 
    # In the vanilla game, rewards given when killing enemies change when you come back to a previously visited planet
    # (bolts & experience). Enabling this option removes this behavior, making the experience and bolts obtained more
    # stable throughout the seed.
    'true': 50
  no_kill_reward_degradation:
    # In the vanilla game, rewards given by a specific enemy decrease each time you kill it (bolts & experience).
    # Enabling this option removes this behavior, making the experience and bolts obtained more stable throughout
    # the seed.
    'true': 50
  free_challenge_selection:
    # Makes all hoverbike and spaceship challenges selectable right away, which means you don't have to win a
    # challenge to access the next one.
    'false': 50
  nanotech_xp_multiplier:
    # A multiplier applied to experience gained for Nanotech levels, in percent.
    # You can define additional values between the minimum and maximum values.
    # Minimum value is 20
    # Maximum value is 600
    120: 50
  weapon_xp_multiplier:
    # A multiplier applied to experience gained for weapon levels, in percent.

    # Minimum value is 30
    # Maximum value is 600
    120: 50
  extra_spaceship_challenge_locations:
    # In the vanilla game, only the first challenge and the race challenge completed perfectly give an item as a
    # reward. If enabled, this option makes all spaceship challenges reward an item on first completion.
    'false': 50
  extend_weapon_progression: 
    # If enabled, make all weapon tiers obtainable through weapon experience. This means LV2 (orange) weapons can
    # upgrade into LV3 (yellow) weapons, which can then upgrade into LV4 (blue) weapons.
    # This effectively makes all weapons that are usually restricted to NG+ available with enough grinding.
    'true': 50
  first_person_mode_glitch_in_logic:
    # Determines if logic should take first person mode glitches into account when evaluating which locations are reachable.
    # Various difficulty levels can be picked:
    # - Easy: simple climbs (e.g. getting the Platinum Bolt near Oozla scientist)
    # - Medium: harder climbs and basic lateral movement (e.g. Getting to the Notak Worker Bots without the Heli-pack nor the Thermanator)
    # - Hard: full navigation following walls (e.g. Getting to the Mutated Protopet only with the Infiltrator)
    # Can be disabled with value disabled.
