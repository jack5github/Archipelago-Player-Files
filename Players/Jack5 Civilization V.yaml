  Jack5's Civilization V player file

  This configuration for Sid Meier's Civilization V attempts to remedy the issues faced by locking away most of the game's features by keeping them stored locally, particularly eras and the ability to generate gold, which are the most troublesome things not to have. All traps are enabled for maximum carnage, but the chance is kept low due to their extreme consequences.

  progressive_techs:
    # Use progressive technologies. Progressive technologies divides all 79 technologies (excl. Agriculture) into 11 categories. This makes the unlocking of technologies feel less chaotic and more streamlined compared to true random technologies. It also makes it far less likely to not have important early-era buildings in the mid to late game.
