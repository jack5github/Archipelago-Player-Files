  ##################
  puzzle_count:
    # Number of puzzles to randomly generate.
    #
    # You can define additional values between the minimum and maximum values.
    # Minimum value is 1
    # Maximum value is 2000
    # The default is 50. Other Archipelago games usually have an unlock count of 150, but that is simply too many puzzles to solve, so I have settled on exactly 100.
    100: 50
  starting_puzzles:
    # Number of puzzles to randomly add to the starting inventory. These will be
    # removed from the item pool.
    #
    # You can define additional values between the minimum and maximum values.
    # Minimum value is 0
    # Maximum value is 20
    # Unchanged from the base configuration.
    5: 50
  completion_percentage:
    # Percent of puzzles which must be completed to finish the world, rounding up.
    # 
    # If you set this to a low value, it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to disable release on world completion.
    #
    # You can define additional values between the minimum and maximum values.
    # Minimum value is 10
    # Maximum value is 100
    # Unchanged from the base configuration.
    80: 50
  min_difficulty:
    # Minimum difficulty to select generated presets from. Note that not all genres have presets at "Hard" difficulty,
    # so they will never appear if the minimum difficulty is set to Hard (unless you specify custom presets for them).
    # Unchanged from the base configuration.
    easy: 50
    normal: 0
    hard: 0
  max_difficulty:
    # Maximum difficulty to select generated presets from. Takes priority over the Minimum Difficulty option if it is lower.
    # 
    # Puzzles on "Ridiculous" difficulty are either very big or not actually randomized. Use this difficulty at your own risk.
    # Unchanged from the base configuration.
    easy: 0
    normal: 50
    hard: 0
    ridiculous: 0
  genre_weights:
    # Relative chance for each genre to be selected as a random preset. Set a genre's
    # weight to 0 or remove it from this list to disable it.
    # Some puzzle weights have been changed, and the reasons for doing so are explained below:
    blackbox: 0 # Blackbox is a light reflecting game, but its puzzles seem impossible, as there is no way to place marbles on diagonals.
    bridges: 10
    cube: 0 # Cube is a Bloxorz puzzle that punishes you for moving in the wrong direction.
    dominosa: 0 # It is not immediately clear how to beat Dominosa, nor does it ever become clear.
    fifteen: 0 # Fifteen is a sliding puzzle, which is not fun at all to play.
    filling: 0 # I can never figure out Filling. Even at its smallest size its puzzles prove to be impossible.
    flip: 0 # Flip is a flipping puzzle, which is not fun at all to play.
    flood: 0 # Flood is not colour-blind friendly. Restore this once the game is updated.
    galaxies: 0 # As much as I like Galaxies, even on higher difficulties, it is not kind to my hands, as every cell border needs to be clicked individually.
    guess: 0 # Guess is not colour-blind friendly. Restore this once the game is updated.
    inertia: 10
    keen: 10
    lightup: 10
    loopy: 10
    magnets: 10
    map: 0 # Map is not colour-blind friendly. Restore this once the game is updated.
    mines: 0 # Even on the easiest possible difficulty, Minesweeper can generate a board that requires insane luck to solve first try.
    mosaic: 10
    net: 10
    netslide: 0 # NetSlide is a sliding puzzle, which is not fun at all to play.
    palisade: 0 # When following all the rules of this The Witness-style puzzle, it proves to be impossible.
    pattern: 10
    pearl: 10
    pegs: 0 # Pegs is a 2D peg-hopping game, the second dimension making it ridiculously hard.
    range: 0 # Range gameplay is braindead, mindlessly clicking blocks on and off.
    rect: 10
    samegame: 0 # SameGame is a Super Collapse! puzzle, which is only fun in an arcade context.
    signpost: 0 # Signpost is an arrow-linking game, which is deceptively hard given there are so many possibilities.
    singles: 0 # Even on Easy, Singles is deceptively hard to play, unlike Sudoku.
    sixteen: 0 # Sixteen is a sliding puzzle, which is not fun at all to play.
    slant: 10
    solo: 0 # A bad implementation of Sudoku. If I want to play it, I will play Archipeladoku instead.
    tents: 10
    towers: 10

    twiddle: 0 # Twiddle is a sliding puzzle, which is not fun at all to play.

    untangle: 5 # Untangle puzzles always feel the same, so their chance of occurring is reduced.
  preset_overrides:
    # List of presets to use for a given genre. Replaces the default presets for
    # that puzzle if specified.
    # 
    # For example, to make Net puzzles always use wrapping grids, add:
    # net: [5x5w, 7x7w, 9x9w, 11x11w]
    # Some puzzle presets have been overridden, and the reasons for doing so are explained below:
