  Multiplayer Keymaster's Keep player file by Jack5 and Zeroman95

  This Keymaster's Keep configuration combines Jack5, Zeroman95 and forbo's non-Archipelago-supported games and interests into a single player file, which is more condensed than the Keymaster's Keep default for both simplicity and an added challenge. The main difference is the goal being changed from 'Keymaster's Challenge' to either 'Magic Key Heist' or 'Area Domination', so this config's completion does not hinge on a single challenge. This player file has led to multiple contributions to Keymaster's Keep by Jack5, in particular, the addition of bag size options, the Area Domination goal and forced game selection.

  ################
  goal:
    # Determines the victory condition.
    # Keymasters Challenge: Retrieve X artifacts of resolve to unlock the Keymaster's challenge chamber and beat the ultimate challenge
    # Magic Key Heist: Acquire X magic keys and escape the Keymaster's Keep
    # Area Domination: Acquire conquest medallions by completing all trials in X% of keep areas and escape the Keymaster's Keep
    # Rather than having the entire run hinge on a final challenge (which we've never played) or require a certain number of keys, require a certain number of areas to be completed.
    # Jack5 and Zeroman95 have played Keymaster's Keep many times, and their preferred goals are Magic Key Heist and Area Domination. Because there is a time and a place for both, and they are equally good when compared to each other, there is a random chance that either will be selected. The Keymaster's Challenge is not desired due to the game hinging on a single area.

    # win_with_card: 1
    # win_against_ai: 1

  # props: 4
