  Jack5's PEAK player file

  This PEAK configuration makes a multitude of changes in order for it to have the same responsibility as other player files. The number of Ascents required has been reduced to just 1, additional progressive stamina has been enabled, and Energy Link functionality has been turned on. In addition, a variety of traps have been disabled, with the overall chance of them occurring being increased.
