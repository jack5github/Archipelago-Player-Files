# Archipelago Player Files

This repository contains the Archipelago player files for multiple users in the [Jack5 Community Lobby Discord server](https://discord.gg/scRdSXY) and their preferred games, for use in asynchronous runs.

## Getting started

GitHub requires an SSH key on your computer. To create an SSH key, download [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), open **Git Bash** and execute `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`. Press Enter for every option, then the key will be located in `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\.ssh\` (on Windows) as the contents of the file **id_ed25519.pub**. Copy its contents and paste them as a new SSH key via [this GitHub page](https://github.com/settings/keys). Give the key a title that describes your computer so you remember what it was made on. Also execute the following commands in Git Bash to set up Git:

```bash
git config --global user.name "REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT_DISPLAY_NAME"
git config --global user.email "REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT_EMAIL"
```

To store these player files locally, navigate to your Archipelago folder, open Git Bash inside it and execute `git clone git@github.com:jack5github/Archipelago-Player-Files.git`. If asked about the authenticity of github.com, type `yes`. This will create a new folder, which you can open and edit with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) (Recommended extensions: [Git Graph](https://open-vsx.org/vscode/item?itemName=mhutchie.git-graph), [Notepad++ keymap](https://open-vsx.org/vscode/item?itemName=ms-vscode.notepadplusplus-keybindings)).

## Guidelines

When creating a new player file, start with the template generated by Archipelago's **Generate Template Options** feature, then make the necessary changes to it to be in line with other player files (e.g. [`Jack5 The Witness.yaml`](Players/Jack5%20The%20Witness.yaml)). Be sure to include comments explaining why you've set an option to a particular value. If left unchanged, write `# Unchanged from the base configuration.` Common options' comments are removed and are instead documented in the [repository documentation](docs/).

It is recommended to make a player file that consistently generates between 100-200 unlock locations. This can be tested by generating a world with a single player file, then checking the location count at the top of the spoiler file stored inside the world `.zip`. If it has more than 200, it will be treated as a game with increased responsibility (e.g. 1 player plays 2 games with 150 locations, another plays 1 game with 300 locations).
